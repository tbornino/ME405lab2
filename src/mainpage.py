    @section sec_intro  Introduction
                        This is the documentation site for Tori Bornino,
                        Jackson Mclaughlin, and Zachary Stednitz's code used in
                        ME 405 - Mechatronics, Lab 2: Closed loop controller 
                        driver, taught in Winter 2022 by Dr. John Ridgly.
                        Source code is available at:
                        https://tbornino.github.io/ME405lab2/
                        


    @section sec_con    PID Controller Class
                        We wrote an PID Controller class
                        @ref pidcontroller.PIDController "PIDController"
                        that allows the user to run a step response on the motor.

    @section sec_plt    Plotter Program on PC
                        We wrote a low level user interface
                        @ref plotter "plotter"
                        that allows the user to input the step response gains
                        and then prints the step response data after the step
                        response.
